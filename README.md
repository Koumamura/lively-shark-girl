# Lively-Shark-Girl

*The Eyes-Follow Wallpapers with Shark Girl and be careful not to devour your cursor.*

## Installation Methods:

### 1 Install it as a website:
  - The wallpaper is hosted on [Vercel](https://lively-shark-girl.vercel.app/)  
  - open your Lively Wallpaper click on add wallpaper
  - add the app link in the url field
     
### 2 Automatic installation using a .bat script: (Recomended)

   - Download the .zip file from the repository and extract the contents.

   - Run the `install_wallpaper.bat` script, which will move all the files to the default folder where Lively Wallpapers stores its wallpapers.

   - Completely close your animation, make sure it is not minimized in the Windows tray.

   - ⚠️Note: This method will only work correctly if the user has not changed Lively's default wallpaper installation folder. If the folder has been modified, you will need to manually copy the files to the correct location.
### 3 Manual installation: 
  - Clone the repository using the  command: ``git clone https://github.com/Koumamura/lively-shark-girl.git ``
  - Unzip the .zip:
  - Place the folder in the backgrounds location defined in your Lively Wallpaper
  - Necessary files
    - LivelyInfo.json
    - LivelyProperties.json
    - index.html
    - assets/*
    - src/*

## Customization Notice:

  -⚠️ Important: Only the installation methods 2 (automatic) and 3 (manual) allow for customization of the wallpaper. If you want to modify or adjust any of the files (such as visuals, animations, or settings), you must use one of these two methods, as the website installation (method 1) does not support customization.
